        content: 'electricity market is quickly evolving from a limited number of large centralized power plants to thousands of smaller sustainable generation farms.  This change is causing a challenge for large buyers and sellers to find each other. Many companies want to be proactive and purchase sustainable power, however, many are not in a position to take a 15-20 year position in order to enable a project to be built.  Verde Blocks is American PowerNet’s solution to this problem.  Verde Blocks provides buyers a platform to competitively request wholesale blocks of sustainable power down to a minimum size of 1 MW (1000 KW) for 1 month.  From years of building an infrastructure of ISO memberships and state supplier licenses for large buyers to utilize, American PowerNet is in a unique position to bring all parties together and manage the complexities of physical delivery from the wholesale market to the retail meters.'
