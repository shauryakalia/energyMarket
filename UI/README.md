Verde Blocks in ReactJS with Redux.

# Quick Start

## Architecture Principles

### Presentational Components and Styling

We're using `foundation` to achieve consistent styling. See [here](https://foundation.zurb.com/).

Theme can be adjusted in `src/theme.js`.

### Async Data Fetching

As for data, a simple fetching component called `axios` is being used to handle API calls throughout the application. 

## Start Development Server

Run `npm start` and access the dev environment at http://localhost:3000/
